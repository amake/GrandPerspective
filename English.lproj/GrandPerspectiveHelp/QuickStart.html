<p>
In this tutorial, you will scan a folder, explore the scanned contents, and change the display settings.
</p>

<ol>
<li>From the "File" menu, select <b>Scan Folder</b>.
<br><br>
A File dialog appears
</li>

<li>Select a folder that you want to scan, for example your Home folder and click <b>Scan</b>.
<br><br>
GrandPerspective will start scanning the folder.
For all files in the folder it will retrieve the size, name and some other properties.
When the scan is complete, a view window will be shown which visualises the disk usage of all files in the scanned folder.
Each rectangle corresponds to a file.

</li>

<li>Hover with the mouse over the window.
<br><br>
In the bottom of the window, the name and size of the selected file is shown.
Notice how it changes each time the mouse moves to a different rectangle.
You may also notice that files stored in the same folder appear closely together.
By default, they will have the same color.

</li>

<li>Change the selected palette to "Heatmap 12"
<br><br>
A different palette is selected for coloring the files. This palette has twelve gradually changing colors. It is very suitable in combination with coloring by "Last change". Files that recently have changed have a "hot" color, whereas files that have not changed for a long time, will have a "cold" color.
