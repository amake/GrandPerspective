<p>
GrandPerspective is very stable.
Crashes while it is scanning are fortunately very rare, but have been known to happen.
If it happens to you, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Enable full logging when starting the application.
To do so, start the application from Terminal with <tt>-logAll YES</tt> as commandline argument.<br><br>
For example, when you have version 1.7.0 and mounted it as a volume, type:<br>
<tt>/Volumes/GrandPerspective\ 1.7.0/GrandPerspective.app/Contents/MacOS/GrandPerspective -logAll YES</tt>
</li>

<li>Try to reproduce the crash. Did you manage?

  <ul>
  <li>No, keep trying. 
Go back to Step 2.</li>

  <li>Yes, then inspect the logging in the Terminal to determine which folder it is trying to scan when the crash happens.
Continue to Step 3.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>Try to find the root cause problem by answering the following questions:

  <ul>
  <li>Is it repeatable?
Does it always crash while scanning the same folder?</li>
  <li>Is there anything special about this folder?
For example, does it contain files with unusual characters in their names?</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>Once you manage to reproduce a repeatable crash, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/grandperspectiv/bugs/">submit a bug report for it</a>.
Provide as much details as you can.<br><br>

Note: You can also submit a report when you did not manage to reproduce a repeatable crash.
However, the chance that the problem can then be fixed is much smaller.
</li>
