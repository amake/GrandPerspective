  GrandPerspective, GRANDPERSPECTIVE_SOFTWARE_VERSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* INTRODUCTION

GrandPerspective is a small utility for Mac OS X that can draw two-
dimensional views of disk use within a file system. This can help you
to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders
take up the most space.

The graphical representation is a logical one, where each file is
shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size.
Files in the same folder appear together, but other than that the
placement of files is arbitrary. You can observe this by resizing the
view window. The location of files will change, in order to keep the
rectangles as square as possible.


* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- PowerPC processor

  Unfortunately, GrandPerspective does not yet run on Intel Macs.
  Although this would require only minimal (or no) changes to the 
  code, I currently don't have the software to build Universal 
  Binaries, nor (access to) the hardware to actually test it. 
  Volunteers with an Intel Mac who don't mind being a beta-tester,
  please step forward. :-)

- Mac OS X, 10.2 or higher
  
  Note: The dependency on functionality introduced after Mac OS X 10.0
  is minimal. If you have access to Mac OS X 10.0, feel free to try to 
  make the modifications required to get it to run there. I would 
  gratefully receive any patches. :-)
