  GrandPerspective, GRANDPERSPECTIVE_SOFTWARE_VERSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* INTRODUCTION

GrandPerspective is a small utility for Mac OS X that can draw two-
dimensional views of disk use within a file system. This can help you
to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders
take up the most space.

The graphical representation is a logical one, where each file is
shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size.
Files in the same folder appear together, but other than that the
placement of files is arbitrary. You can observe this by resizing the
view window. The location of files will change, in order to keep the
rectangles as square as possible.


* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- PowerPC/Intel processor

  This version of the application has been released as a Universal 
  Binary. It took a while, but I can now build Universal Binaries 
  from my own machine. Thanks to everyone that has shown support by
  making donations, as these have been used to fund the required 
  upgrade to Leopard. 

  Also thanks to Martin Kahr who made Universal Binaries available
  for earlier releases of GrandPerspective, and to Craig Hughes who
  helped me early on to make the source code Intel-compatible.

- Mac OS X, 10.3 or higher


* CONTENTS

This version of GrandPerspective is released as three separate files:

  * GrandPerspective-GRANDPERSPECTIVE_SOFTWARE_VERSION_ID.dmg
 
      This is the main release file. It contains all you need to run
      the application. To install the application, open the disk 
      image and drag the application icon onto your Applications
      folder, or wher'ever you want to put it onto your file system.
      Next, run the application by clicking on the icon.

  * GrandPerspective-GRANDPERSPECTIVE_SOFTWARE_VERSION_ID-src.tgz

      This contains the source code of the application. It consists of
      the Objective C source code, as well as various auxiliary files,
      such as the nib files that are used to construct the GUI.

  * GrandPerspective-GRANDPERSPECTIVE_SOFTWARE_VERSION_ID-local.dmg
 
      This is the localized version of GrandPerspective. It includes
      support for languages other than English. The translations have 
      been provided by various users of GrandPerspective. See the
      GrandPerspective website for details on how you can help out to 
      make the application available in your mother tongue.

      Note: The localized version of GrandPerpective is typically 
      released a short while after the main release in order for the
      localized resources to be updated as necessary.
