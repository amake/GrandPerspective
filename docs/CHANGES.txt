  Version 0.93, 22-01-2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.92:

- New functionality:
  - Selected files can now be opened in Finder. This can be used to examine
    files and folders in more detail, and to optionally remove, move or edit
    files.
  - An image of the directory view can now be generated and saved (as a TIFF
    image).

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored ItemTreeDrawer into two classes. ItemTreeDrawer now does the 
    basic drawing, and AsynchronousItemTreeDrawer manages drawing in a 
    separate thread.

- Bug fix:
  - The thread used for drawing in the background is now properly terminated
    and disposed of when it is not needed anymore.

  Version 0.92, 10-01-2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.91:

- New functionality:
  - Added a "twin window" command. This is like the "duplicate window" 
    command, except that navigation of the directory tree in the new window is
    synchronized with its parent window.

- Improved functionality:
  - When duplicating a window, the file colouring scheme and the path in the 
    tree are now also copied.

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored code so that it adheres much better to the MVC pattern.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed bug that would occassionally prevent redrawing of the directory 
    view. (ID 1309819)
  - Plugged a big memory leak. The directory tree is now actually freed when
    all windows that refer to it are closed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.90:

- Now building with ZeroLink disabled, so that the application should actually
  run on machines other than my own. :-)

- Optimised view drawing. Drawing the tree map of my entire hard drive 
  contents at 1280x1024 resolution on my Mac Mini now takes only half a
  second.

First release of GrandPerspective.

Features:

- A view showing directory trees graphically:
  - Layout of files using a basic balanced tree building algorithm.
  - Drawing of files using basic gradient filling.

- Support for different file colouring schemes. Colouring by: 
  - Directory name (i.e. a hash of the name)
  - File name (i.e. a hash of the name)
  - File type (i.e. hash of file extension)
  - Nothing (all files same colour)

- Selection of a file in the view:
  - To descend into the directory tree.
  - To enable copying of file path. 

- Support for multiple windows:
  - Scan different folder and show in new window.
  - Duplication of an existing window (to view data differently).
