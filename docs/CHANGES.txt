======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.9.10 (localized), 20-01-2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New localizations:
- Spanish, by Javier Alfonso
- French, by Maxime Hadjinlian

Updated localizations:
- Japanese, by Chris Li
- German, by Helge Baumann
- Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.9.10, 12-12-2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
- Added ability to show the entire volume on which the scanned folder
  resides, including free space.
- Added ability to select folders in the view window. By default, 
  files are still selected, but you can select folders using the
  scrollwheel of the mouse or the "[" and "]" keys.

Minor improvements:
- The "Info" panel has been pimped:
  - It more elegantly shows the folder that has been scanned, 
    together with the volume it is on.
  - It now also shows the size of volume and the amount of 
    miscellaneous used space. 
- Added more color palettes, each with at least eight colors. Removed
  several old palettes that had relatively few colors.
- Made the path to the selected file more clearly visible in the view.
- Improved drawing of the view so that it does not unnecessarily
  "flash" when it is updated.

Minor meta changes:
- Changed version numbering scheme to allow this release before
  releasing Version 1.00. (Just insert a dot in the version numbers
  of all earlier releases for the new numbering to make sense)

Code clean-up:
- Drastically refactored the code in order to cleanly add the new
  functionality.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.99 (localized), 28-03-2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated localizations:
- Japanese, by Chris Li
- German, by Helge Baumann
- Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.99, 24-02-2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
- Added choice of file size measure. You can choose between logical
  file size (the default), and physical file size.
- Added help. Hopefully rarely needed, but at least it exists.

Changes to the release files:
- The application has been released as a Universal Binary.
- The source release has been extended, and now includes everything
  needed to build the application. Newly included:
  - The (cleaned up) project file.
  - The help documentation.
  - All Dutch resources (as an example for other localizers).

Tiny changes:
- Made titles of various panels and their default buttons more
  specific.
- Moved all localizable names into new Names.strings file.
- Moved all color palettes into "Palettes" subfolder.
- Enlarged bounding box of text fields where there was room (to
  facilitate localization).

Bug fixes:
- Enabling a filename or path test without specifying any strings 
  does not give an error anymore.
- It was possible to specify a negative file size bound, which
  resulted in a very large size. Not any more.
- It was possible (to attempt) to save an image with a dimension that
  was zero or negative. This resulted in an exception. Not anymore.
- When a "void" test was returned after adding or editing a mask or
  filter rule an exception occurred. This has been fixed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.98 (localized), 09-01-2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated localizations:
- Japanese, by Chris Li
- German, by Helge Baumann
- Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.98, 15-12-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
- Masking and filtering rules that are created (or modified) by the 
  user are now stored in the user preferences so that they are
  available next time the application is run.
- The default file item tests are now read from the information
  properties file, instead of being hardcoded in the application.
- String tests support case-insensitive matching.
- Now also showing human-friendly file sizes in the Info and Focus
  panels.
- Added button for removing all tests from the filter in the
  "Edit Filter" window.

Minor improvements:
- The path test now applies to path of the folder where the file item
  resides (excluding the name of the file itself). This way it better
  complements the name test.
- Path strings are cached during filtering or drawing of the file
  item tree for improved performance.
- Changed size of main window to 640x480.
- Internationalized the OK and Cancel buttons of alert panels.

Bug fix:
- When an image was saved, the "Clown Barf" palette was always used, 
  irrespective of the palette used by the view. This has been fixed.
- The CFBundleSignature, CFBundleIdentifier, and CFBundleVersion 
  properties in Info.plist were not set correctly. This, for instance,
  meant that preferences were incorrectly associated with the 
  example com.apple.myCocoaApp application. This has been fixed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.97 (localized), 10-12-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New localizations:
- Japanese, by Chris Li
- German, by Helge Baumann
- Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.97, 14-11-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
- There is now a choice of color palettes.
  - The palettes that can be chosen have been taken from the 
    ColorSchemer gallery at http://www.colorschemer.com/schemes/.
    Thanks to the following users for providing one or more color 
    schemes: copperblue, tumuchtime, Jalle, Nemoflow, and rageforst.
- Preferences can now be changed and stored. This means that you
  can change the default color mapping and default color palette.
- The application has been fully internationalized. This means that
  localized versions can now be generated.
  - See LOCALIZATION.TXT for details on how you can help to make
    GrandPerspective available in your language.

Minor improvements:
- Zero-sized items are not included in the tree anymore. This 
  reduces the memory footprint and stops tree paths from being 
  drawn when the tree has a total size of zero.

Code clean-up:
- Renamed FileItemHashingOptions to FileItemHashingCollection and
  more generally made it match the new ColorListCollection class.
  Also renamed instances of FileItemHashing to colorMapping.

Bug fixes:
- Closing Filter Window would freeze application (see 1562627)
- Selecting an empty filter would throw an assertion (see 1562627).
- It used to be possible for a test that was not available to be 
  selected anyway, which could cause various anomalous behaviours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.96, 12-08-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.95:

- New functionality:
  - Added ability to filter a directory view window, which generates 
    a new window with a "filtered view". The filter determines which
    files are shown in the new window.
    - If a filter has been applied this is reflected in the window
      title.
  - Added a drawer to directory view windows. It has three panels:
    - An "Info" panel with details about the files that are shown
      in the view, including: 
      - the time of scan,
      - the folder that was scanned, and
      - details of the filter that has been applied (if any).
    - A "Display" panel for configuring the way the view is drawn. 
      Here you can specify:
      - how files are colored, and
      - the mask that is used (if any).
    - A "Focus" panel with details about:
      - the folder that is currently shown in the view, and
      - the file that is currently selected.

- Tiny changes:
  - The button for revealing a file in Finder has been renamed to 
    "Reveal" (it used to be "Show").
  - The file coloring options "directory" and "top directory" have 
    been renamed to "folder" and "top folder" respectively.
  - Cosmetic changes to the "Edit Filter" window.

- Code cleanup:
  - The progress panel has been refactored. It is now also used when
    filtering takes place.
  - All tasks and executors have been moved to a new "task" folder.
  - Simplified the code that creates the attributed string for the 
    selected file.
  - The contents of PopUpButtons are now set in their nib file 
    instead of programmatically.

- Bug fix:
  - Plugged a memory leak in the image drawing code.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.95, 05-07-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.94:

- New functionality:
  - Added ability to mask files. When a file is masked it is not
    drawn, but still takes up space in the view. Masking files is 
    handy for quickly spotting certain types of file.
    - A mask can be quickly enabled or disabled.
    - A test for masking can be created quickly by selecting one or
      more existing rules.
    - Existing rules can be edited and new ones can be created.
    - Rules can take the name of the file into account, its size, and 
      its path.
    - Rules can be identified by their friendly name, but a full
      description can optionally also be shown.

- Tiny changes:
  - Added coloring by "top directory" option as suggested by Adrian 
    Sampson (ID 1501479).
  - Made color-mapping choice in directory view a pop-up button.
  - Added keyboard shortcuts for Re-scan and Filter commands.
  - The SaveImageDialog is now centered.

- Code cleanup:
  - The code is now spread across various folders.
  - Made implementation of TreeLayoutTraverser protocol explicit.
  - Split BalancingTreeBuilder in two: TreeBuilder and TreeBalancer.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.94, 09-05-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.93:

- New functionality:
  - There is now a "rescan" command which generates an up-to-date 
    window given an existing one. You can use this command after you
    have moved or deleted several files and folders.

- Tiny changes:
  - Window titles now include the time of the scan and, if needed,
    an additional number, to make each title unique.
  - The scan progress panel now shows the name of the folder that is
    being scanned.
  - Renamed the "Open" button of the directory view window to "Show".
  - Renamed the "Scan directory..." command to "Scan Folder...".

- Code clean up:
  - Generalised the execution of background threads in the new
    AsynchronousTaskManager class, which is now used for both drawing
    and rescanning in a background thread. 
  - The scan progress panel has been moved into a nib of its own,
    and now has a dedicated control: ScanProgressPanelControl.

- Bug fix:
  - Fixed the drawing code so that it also runs properly when
    compiled for Intel Macs. Many thanks to Craig Hughes for his
    help with this.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.93, 22-01-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.92:

- New functionality:
  - Selected files can now be opened in Finder. This can be used to 
    examine files and folders in more detail, and to optionally 
    remove, move or edit files.
  - An image of the directory view can now be generated and saved (as
    a TIFF image).

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored ItemTreeDrawer into two classes. ItemTreeDrawer now
    does the basic drawing, and AsynchronousItemTreeDrawer manages
    drawing in a separate thread.

- Bug fix:
  - The thread used for drawing in the background is now properly
    terminated and disposed of when it is not needed anymore.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.92, 10-01-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.91:

- New functionality:
  - Added a "twin window" command. This is like the "duplicate window" 
    command, except that navigation of the directory tree in the new
    window is synchronized with its parent window.

- Improved functionality:
  - When duplicating a window, the file colouring scheme and the path
    in the tree are now also copied.

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored code so that it adheres much better to the MVC pattern.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed bug that would occassionally prevent redrawing of the
    directory view. (ID 1309819)
  - Plugged a big memory leak. The directory tree is now actually
    freed when all windows that refer to it are closed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.91, 30-09-2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.90:

- Now building with ZeroLink disabled, so that the application should
  actually run on machines other than my own. :-)

- Optimised view drawing. Drawing the tree map of my entire hard drive 
  contents at 1280x1024 resolution on my Mac Mini now takes only half
  a second.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.90, 20-09-2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First release of GrandPerspective.

Features:

- A view showing directory trees graphically:
  - Layout of files using a basic balanced tree building algorithm.
  - Drawing of files using basic gradient filling.

- Support for different file colouring schemes. Colouring by: 
  - Directory name (i.e. a hash of the name)
  - File name (i.e. a hash of the name)
  - File type (i.e. hash of file extension)
  - Nothing (all files same colour)

- Selection of a file in the view:
  - To descend into the directory tree.
  - To enable copying of file path. 

- Support for multiple windows:
  - Scan different folder and show in new window.
  - Duplication of an existing window (to view data differently).
