  Version 0.97 (localized), 10-12-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New localizations:
- Japanese, by Chris Li
- German, by Helge Baumann
- Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.97, 14-11-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
- There is now a choice of color palettes.
  - The palettes that can be chosen have been taken from the 
    ColorSchemer gallery at http://www.colorschemer.com/schemes/.
    Thanks to the following users for providing one or more color 
    schemes: copperblue, tumuchtime, Jalle, Nemoflow, and rageforst.
- Preferences can now be changed and stored. This means that you
  can change the default color mapping and default color palette.
- The application has been fully internationalized. This means that
  localized versions can now be generated.
  - See LOCALIZATION.TXT for details on how you can help to make
    GrandPerspective available in your language.

Minor improvements:
- Zero-sized items are not included in the tree anymore. This 
  reduces the memory footprint and stops tree paths from being 
  drawn when the tree has a total size of zero.

Code clean-up:
- Renamed FileItemHashingOptions to FileItemHashingCollection and
  more generally made it match the new ColorListCollection class.
  Also renamed instances of FileItemHashing to colorMapping.

Bug fixes:
- Closing Filter Window would freeze application (see 1562627)
- Selecting an empty filter would throw an assertion (see 1562627).
- It used to be possible for a test that was not available to be 
  selected anyway, which could cause various anomalous behaviours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.96, 12-08-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.95:

- New functionality:
  - Added ability to filter a directory view window, which generates 
    a new window with a "filtered view". The filter determines which
    files are shown in the new window.
    - If a filter has been applied this is reflected in the window
      title.
  - Added a drawer to directory view windows. It has three panels:
    - An "Info" panel with details about the files that are shown
      in the view, including: 
      - the time of scan,
      - the folder that was scanned, and
      - details of the filter that has been applied (if any).
    - A "Display" panel for configuring the way the view is drawn. 
      Here you can specify:
      - how files are colored, and
      - the mask that is used (if any).
    - A "Focus" panel with details about:
      - the folder that is currently shown in the view, and
      - the file that is currently selected.

- Tiny changes:
  - The button for revealing a file in Finder has been renamed to 
    "Reveal" (it used to be "Show").
  - The file coloring options "directory" and "top directory" have 
    been renamed to "folder" and "top folder" respectively.
  - Cosmetic changes to the "Edit Filter" window.

- Code cleanup:
  - The progress panel has been refactored. It is now also used when
    filtering takes place.
  - All tasks and executors have been moved to a new "task" folder.
  - Simplified the code that creates the attributed string for the 
    selected file.
  - The contents of PopUpButtons are now set in their nib file 
    instead of programmatically.

- Bug fix:
  - Plugged a memory leak in the image drawing code.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.95, 05-07-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.94:

- New functionality:
  - Added ability to mask files. When a file is masked it is not
    drawn, but still takes up space in the view. Masking files is 
    handy for quickly spotting certain types of file.
    - A mask can be quickly enabled or disabled.
    - A test for masking can be created quickly by selecting one or
      more existing rules.
    - Existing rules can be edited and new ones can be created.
    - Rules can take the name of the file into account, its size, and 
      its path.
    - Rules can be identified by their friendly name, but a full
      description can optionally also be shown.

- Tiny changes:
  - Added coloring by "top directory" option as suggested by Adrian 
    Sampson (ID 1501479).
  - Made color-mapping choice in directory view a pop-up button.
  - Added keyboard shortcuts for Re-scan and Filter commands.
  - The SaveImageDialog is now centered.

- Code cleanup:
  - The code is now spread across various folders.
  - Made implementation of TreeLayoutTraverser protocol explicit.
  - Split BalancingTreeBuilder in two: TreeBuilder and TreeBalancer.

  Version 0.94, 09-05-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.93:

- New functionality:
  - There is now a "rescan" command which generates an up-to-date 
    window given an existing one. You can use this command after you
    have moved or deleted several files and folders.

- Tiny changes:
  - Window titles now include the time of the scan and, if needed,
    an additional number, to make each title unique.
  - The scan progress panel now shows the name of the folder that is
    being scanned.
  - Renamed the "Open" button of the directory view window to "Show".
  - Renamed the "Scan directory..." command to "Scan Folder...".

- Code clean up:
  - Generalised the execution of background threads in the new
    AsynchronousTaskManager class, which is now used for both drawing
    and rescanning in a background thread. 
  - The scan progress panel has been moved into a nib of its own,
    and now has a dedicated control: ScanProgressPanelControl.

- Bug fix:
  - Fixed the drawing code so that it also runs properly when
    compiled for Intel Macs. Many thanks to Craig Hughes for his
    help with this.

  Version 0.93, 22-01-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.92:

- New functionality:
  - Selected files can now be opened in Finder. This can be used to 
    examine files and folders in more detail, and to optionally 
    remove, move or edit files.
  - An image of the directory view can now be generated and saved (as
    a TIFF image).

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored ItemTreeDrawer into two classes. ItemTreeDrawer now
    does the basic drawing, and AsynchronousItemTreeDrawer manages
    drawing in a separate thread.

- Bug fix:
  - The thread used for drawing in the background is now properly
    terminated and disposed of when it is not needed anymore.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.92, 10-01-2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.91:

- New functionality:
  - Added a "twin window" command. This is like the "duplicate window" 
    command, except that navigation of the directory tree in the new
    window is synchronized with its parent window.

- Improved functionality:
  - When duplicating a window, the file colouring scheme and the path
    in the tree are now also copied.

- Code clean up:
  - Refactored code so that it adheres much better to the MVC pattern.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed bug that would occassionally prevent redrawing of the
    directory view. (ID 1309819)
  - Plugged a big memory leak. The directory tree is now actually
    freed when all windows that refer to it are closed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.91, 30-09-2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 0.90:

- Now building with ZeroLink disabled, so that the application should
  actually run on machines other than my own. :-)

- Optimised view drawing. Drawing the tree map of my entire hard drive 
  contents at 1280x1024 resolution on my Mac Mini now takes only half
  a second.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 0.90, 20-09-2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First release of GrandPerspective.

Features:

- A view showing directory trees graphically:
  - Layout of files using a basic balanced tree building algorithm.
  - Drawing of files using basic gradient filling.

- Support for different file colouring schemes. Colouring by:

  - File name (i.e. a hash of the name)

  - Nothing (all files same colour)

- Selection of a file in the view:
  - To descend into the directory tree.
  - To enable copying of file path. 

- Support for multiple windows:
  - Scan different folder and show in new window.
  - Duplication of an existing window (to view data differently).
