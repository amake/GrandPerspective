  GrandPerspective Localization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

GrandPerspective is fully internationalized which means that it can 
be localized to support languages other than English.

The following localizations are available in the latest (localized)
release of GrandPerspective:

  * Japanese, by Chris Li
  * Spanish, by Javier Alfonso
  * French, by Maxime Hadjinlian
  * Dutch, by Erwin Bonsma

Some other localizations have been created for earlier versions of
the application: 

  * German, by Helge Baumann

Unfortunately, this one has not been updated for the latest release.
Hopefully it will be resurrected in a future release. Maybe by you?

You may be able to help out with making GrandPerspective available 
in your mother tongue, or any other languages you speak fluently. To
see how you could help check out the following page:

Thanks to everyone who has been providing localizations for
GrandPerspective so far!
