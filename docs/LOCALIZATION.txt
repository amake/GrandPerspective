  GrandPerspective Localization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From Version 0.97 onwards GrandPerspective is fully internationalized.
This means that it can be localized to support languages other than
English. I can manage the translation into Dutch, but for any other
language, I will need your help.

So, hereby a call for volunteers. If you want to help out with making
GrandPerspective available in your mother tongue, or any other 
languages you speak fluently, check out the GrandPerspective website 
to see how you could help:

The following localizations have been provided so far:

  * Japanese (Version 0.97), by Chris Li
  * German (Version 0.97), by Helge Bauman
  * Dutch (Version 0.97), by Erwin Bonsma 

Thanks,

Erwin Bonsma
