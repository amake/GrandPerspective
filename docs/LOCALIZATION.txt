  GrandPerspective Localization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From Version 0.97 onwards GrandPerspective is fully internationalized.
This means that it can be localized to support languages other than
English.

The following localizations are available in the latest (localized)
release of GrandPerspective:

  * Japanese (Version 0.97 and up), by Chris Li
  * Dutch (Version 0.97 and up), by Erwin Bonsma

Some other localizations have been created for earlier versions of
the application: 

  * German (Version 0.97 until Version 0.9.10), by Helge Baumann
  * Spanish (Version 0.9.10), by Javier Alfonso
  * French (Version 0.9.10), by Maxime Hadjinlian

Unfortunately, these have not been updated for the latest release.
Hopefully they will be resurrected for future releases. 

You may even be able to help out with making GrandPerspective
available in your mother tongue, or any other languages you speak 
fluently. To see how you could help check out the following page:

Thanks to everyone who has been providing localizations already.
