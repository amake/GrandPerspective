/* Returns a memory zone that is intended for storing an Item tree. Depending on the preference

 * private zone for the given tree.
 *
 * Using a dedicated zone can be beneficial because the life-span of all objects in a tree is
 * identical, and typically long-lived. As short-lived, temporary objects needed during tree
 * construction are created in the default zone, they won't be mixed in memory. This should result
 * in far less (hardly any) memory fragmentation, which means that memory is used more efficiently.
