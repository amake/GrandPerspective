<h2>About GrandPerspective</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is a small utility application for Mac OS X that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. It uses a so called tree map for visualisation. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together, but their placement is otherwise arbitrary.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li><p><b>15 Dec 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.98 has been released. The main new feature is that user created masking and filtering rules are now automatically stored when the application terminates, so that they are also available the next time. Quite a few other improvements as well, so worth a <a href="#download">download</a> I'd say. But then again, I would say that, wouldn't I?</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Dec 2006</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.97 is now available. It is the first localized GrandPerspective release and includes translations into Japanese, German, and Dutch. <a href="#download">Download</a> it from the official release area if you are interested. Is your favourite language still missing? Maybe you can <a href="#localization">provide it yourself</a>.

<li><p><b>14 Nov 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.97 has been released. It offers a choice of palettes now, all of which more aesthetically pleasing than the original one. You can now also set a few preferences. Go ahead, <a href="#download">download it</a>, and feast your eyes. This version is also fully internationalized. So please help out with <a href="#localization">localization</a> if you can.</p></li>

<li><p><b>12 Aug 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.96 has been released. It supports "filtered" views, and the GUI has been streamlined as well. Don't be shy, <a href="#download">download it</a> and give filtering a try.</p></li>

<li><p><b>5 Jun 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.95 has been released. It includes the ability to "mask" files in the view. This is handy for quickly spotting certain types of files. <a href="#download">Download</a> the latest release and give masking a go.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 May 2006</b> There is now an unofficial Universal Binary for GrandPerspective available, thanks to Martin Kahr. See the <a href="#download">Download section</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 May 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.94 has been released. It includes the new "re-scan" command, which can generate up-to-date views after you have cleaned up your file system a bit. Furthermore, more minor changes to the GUI, as well as to the source code. <a href="#download">Download</a> and enjoy.</p></li>

<li><p><b>14 Apr 2006</b> After noticing a surge in downloads of GrandPerspective I found out that it had been featured as <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/04/download_of_the_day_grandpersp.html">download of the day</a> on O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter.com</a>. Great! By the way, I can generally recommend <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly books</a>, two of which I actually used to develop GrandPerspective.</p>

<p>My apologies for the recent lull in GrandPerspective's further development. I have been busy with other things lately, but expect another release soon, hopefully as a Universal Binary.</p></li>

<li><p><b>22 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.93 has been released. It features the most requested feature enhancement so far, the ability to open files in Finder. On top of that, you can now save an image of the directory tree to file. Why are you still reading this? Just <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.92 has been released. I finally had some time to code again, and this new release is the result. It features the new Twin Window command, an improved Duplicate Window command and includes two bug fixes. So go ahead and <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 Oct 2005</b> Sorry, don't expect any new release of GrandPerspective for the next two months or so. Although I am keen to extend it further, I'm in the process of moving house, which will suck up most of my spare time in the forseeable future. Just so you know...</p></li>

<p>Martin Kahr has built a Universal Binary for GrandPerspective and very kindly made it available through his website. I have not tested it extensively, but it seems to run fine on my PowerPC-based Mac Mini. Should there be problems when running on an Intel Mac, let me know by submitting a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770694">bug report</a>. I will then attempt to fix the source code accordingly. Please be detailed in your description of the error (I will not be able to reproduce it as I do not have access to an Intel Mac).</p></li>

</ul>
</p>

<a name="localization">
<h2>Localization</h2></a>

<p>From Version 0.97 onwards GrandPerspective is fully internationalized. This means that it can be localized to support languages other than English. I can manage the translation into Dutch, but for any other language, I will need your help. So, hereby a call for volunteers. If you want to help out with making GrandPerspective available in your mother tongue, or any other language you speak fluently, here is how to go about it:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Go to the GrandPerspective <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=634668">Localization forum</a> to check if somebody is already working on the specific localization you have in mind. If so, see if you can somehow help out. Otherwise, you can announce your plans to work on a new localization on the forum.</p></li>

<li><p>Localize the English resources in the <code>English.lproj</code> folder. You should take the resources from the source code distribution, as this includes the <code>classes.nib</code> and <code>info.nib</code> files that InterfaceBuilder needs. Localize all nib files and all strings files one by one. This requires the use of XCode and InterfaceBuilder. See Apple's developer documentation for details.</p></li>

<li><p>When you think you're done, test your work. Run GrandPerspective using your locaized resources. First check that there is nothing you have forgotten to translate. Secondly, check that everything still works.</p></li>

<li><p>All okay? Then upload your localized resources to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=901452">Localizations Tracker</a>. You could also add a message to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=634668">Localization forum</a>. This way, other users can already use them if they want, and report any problems there may be.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I intend to release a localized version of GrandPerspective, which includes all localizations that have been provided. The aim is to do this <em>four weeks after the release of the English version</em>. This should give enough time for localization to take place, yet means that users won't have to wait too long for this localized release.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>After you have downloaded and run GrandPerspective, feel free to provide feedback:

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770694">browse and submit bug reports</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770697">browse and submit feature requests</a>.</li>
<li>For other feedback, you can use one of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=148156">forums for GrandPerspective.</a>
</ul></p>

<p>GrandPerspective is certainly not the first of its kind. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml">Tree maps have been around for a while</a>, and their application to file systems is not novel either. A few other disk usage visualisation tools that employ tree maps are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/">Sequoiaview</a>, which is the one I bumped into first, because as it happens it was developed in Eindhoven, which is where I currently live.</li>

<li><a href="http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/">KDirStat</a> and <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a> I need to mention, if only because they are also hosted on <a href="sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. I haven't tried them though.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.derlien.com/index.html">Disk Inventory X</a> is noteworthy because it also runs on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, why GrandPerspective? Well, as you may have guessed it's a fun little coding project and I needed to pick something to code on my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>. Having said that, it does have a few things going for it. Firstly, GrandPerspective is developed specifically for Mac OS X, which narrows the immediate competition down to Disk Inventory X, as far as I'm aware. Secondly, GrandPerspective has its own way of visualising directory trees. The layout algorithm that is used is simple and effective, but novel to the best of my knowledge. Also, the file rectangles are drawn to be as clear and unobtrusive as possible. Whether you like it or not is a matter of taste, but you've got a choice. Thirdly, GrandPerspective will intentionally be kept as basic as possible. It should do one thing only, and do it well. That means it is a lean and mean application. GrandPerspective's memory requirements and the size it occupies on disk are pretty minimal. For those concerned about disk space, the latter must count for something, right? Finally, it has a cute logo that will enhance anyone's Dock. ;-) </p>
