<h2>About GrandPerspective</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is a small utility application for Mac OS X that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. It uses a so called tree map for visualisation. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together, but their placement is otherwise arbitrary.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>12 Aug 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.96 has been released. It supports "filtered" views, and the GUI has been streamlined as well. Don't be shy, <a href="#download">download it</a> and give filtering a try.</p></li>

<li><p><b>5 Jun 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.95 has been released. It includes the ability to "mask" files in the view. This is handy for quickly spotting certain types of files. <a href="#download">Download</a> the latest release and give masking a go.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 May 2006</b> There is now an unofficial Universal Binary for GrandPerspective available, thanks to Martin Kahr. See the <a href="#download">Download section</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 May 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.94 has been released. It includes the new "re-scan" command, which can generate up-to-date views after you have cleaned up your file system a bit. Furthermore, more minor changes to the GUI, as well as to the source code. <a href="#download">Download</a> and enjoy.</p></li>

<li><p><b>14 Apr 2006</b> After noticing a surge in downloads of GrandPerspective I found out that it had been featured as <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/04/download_of_the_day_grandpersp.html">download of the day</a> on O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter.com</a>. Great! By the way, I can generally recommend <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly books</a>, two of which I actually used to develop GrandPerspective.</p>

<p>My apologies for the recent lull in GrandPerspective's further development. I have been busy with other things lately, but expect another release soon, hopefully as a Universal Binary.</p></li>

<li><p><b>22 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.93 has been released. It features the most requested feature enhancement so far, the ability to open files in Finder. On top of that, you can now save an image of the directory tree to file. Why are you still reading this? Just <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.92 has been released. I finally had some time to code again, and this new release is the result. It features the new Twin Window command, an improved Duplicate Window command and includes two bug fixes. So go ahead and <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 Oct 2005</b> Sorry, don't expect any new release of GrandPerspective for the next two months or so. Although I am keen to extend it further, I'm in the process of moving house, which will suck up most of my spare time in the forseeable future. Just so you know...</p></li>

<p>Martin Kahr has built a Universal Binary for GrandPerspective and very kindly made it available through his website. I have not tested it extensively, but it seems to run fine on my PowerPC-based Mac Mini. Should there be problems when running on an Intel Mac, let me know by submitting a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770694">bug report</a>. I will then attempt to fix the source code accordingly. Please be detailed in your description of the error (I will not be able to reproduce it as I do not have access to an Intel Mac).</p></li>

<p>GrandPerspective is certainly not the first of its kind. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml">Tree maps have been around for a while</a>, and their application to file systems is not novel either. A few other disk usage visualisation tools that employ tree maps are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/">Sequoiaview</a>, which is the one I bumped into first, because as it happens it was developed in Eindhoven, which is where I currently live.</li>

<li><a href="http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/">KDirStat</a> and <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a> I need to mention, if only because they are also hosted on <a href="sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. I haven't tried them though.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.derlien.com/index.html">Disk Inventory X</a> is noteworthy because it also runs on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, why GrandPerspective? Well, as you may have guessed it's a fun little coding project and I needed to pick something to code on my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>. Having said that, it does have a few things going for it. Firstly, GrandPerspective is developed specifically for Mac OS X, which narrows the immediate competition down to Disk Inventory X, as far as I'm aware. Secondly, GrandPerspective has its own way of visualising directory trees. The layout algorithm that is used is simple and effective, but novel to the best of my knowledge. Also, the file rectangles are drawn to be as clear and unobtrusive as possible. Whether you like it or not is a matter of taste, but you've got a choice. Thirdly, GrandPerspective will intentionally be kept as basic as possible. It should do one thing only, and do it well. That means it is a lean and mean application. GrandPerspective's memory requirements and the size it occupies on disk are pretty minimal. For those concerned about disk space, the latter must count for something, right? Finally, it has a cute logo that will enhance anyone's Dock. ;-) </p>
