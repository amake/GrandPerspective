<h2>About GrandPerspective</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is a small utility application for Mac OS X that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. It uses a so called tree map for visualisation. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together, but their placement is otherwise arbitrary.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li><p><b>1 Oct 2008</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.9.13.1 is now available for <a href="#download">download</a>. It's available in Japanese, Spanish, French and Dutch. By the way, I am still looking for <a href="localization.html">more translations</a> for the upcoming Version 1.00 release.</p></li>

<li><p><b>29 Aug 2008</b> GrandPerspective 0.9.13.1 has been released and is available for <a href="#download">download</a>. This release fixes two bugs in 0.9.13 that could (on some systems) cause crashes when scanning in folder contents.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>26 Aug 2008</b> GrandPerspective 0.9.13 has been released and is available for <a href="#download">download</a>. This release features the ability to store scan results to file and lets you load these results again at a later time. Furthermore, progress reporting for long-running tasks has been improved. There have been several minor improvements as well, and a few bugs have been fixed.</p></li> 

<li><p><a name="news-20080713"><b>13 Jul 2008</b></a> 
There will likely not be a localized version of GrandPerspective 0.9.12.
The reason is that I have not received any <a href="#localization">updated localizations</a>. 
The fairly high release rate of GrandPerspective may have been wearing existing localizers out a bit.
To give them some well-earned rest, I have not actively chased them for a change.
I am now instead aiming for a <a href="localization.html#version1_00">localized Version 1.00</a> of GrandPerspective in as many languages as possible.
</p>

<p> 
Of course, should I still receive localizations for Version 0.9.12, or if anyone is interested in a localized release of GrandPerspective with only the Dutch language (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=634668">laat het mij dan weten</a>), a localized release of GrandPerspective 0.9.12 may still appear.
</p></li> 

<li><p><b>14 Jun 2008</b> GrandPerspective 0.9.12.1 is available for <a href="#download">download</a>. It fixes a bug in 0.9.12 that could cause the application to crash when using a Path test applied to folders in a filter.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>10 Jun 2008</b> GrandPerspective 0.9.12 has been released and is available for <a href="#download">download</a>. It includes three eagerly awaited features: correct handling of hard-links (scan your Time Machine back-ups), optional showing of package contents, and the ability to apply mask and filter rules to folders.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>22 Apr 2008</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.9.11 is now available for <a href="#download">download</a>. Unfortunately, it contains fewer localizations than the previous release, mostly because various localizers were too busy to provide an update in their language. Maybe you can <a href="#localization">help out</a> for the next release? Furthermore, thanks to all who have shown support by <a href="#donations">making a donation</a>. Thanks to a recent generous donation the upgrade to Leopard is nearly covered (the dollar being a bit weak doesn't help unfortunately) so expect improved support for OS X 10.5 in the next release.</p></li>

<li><p><b>17 Apr 2008</b> GrandPerspective has been downloaded more than 100.000 times. Happy happy joy joy.</p></li>

<li><p><b>18 Mar 2008</b> GrandPerspective 0.9.11 has been released and is available for <a href="#download">download</a>. It includes two long-awaited features: deletion of files and folders from within the application, and the ability to color files by their file type.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>20 Jan 2008</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.9.10 is now available for <a href="#download">download</a>. Sorry that it has taken slightly longer than usual, but that was mostly due to the holidays.</p></li>

<h2>Related software</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is certainly not the first of its kind. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml">Tree maps have been around for a while</a>, and their application to file systems is not novel either. A few other disk usage visualisation tools that employ tree maps are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/">Sequoiaview</a>, which is the one I bumped into first, because as it happens it was developed in Eindhoven, which is where I currently live.</li>

<li><a href="http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/">KDirStat</a> and <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a> I need to mention, if only because they are also hosted on <a href="sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. I haven't tried them though.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.derlien.com/index.html">Disk Inventory X</a> is noteworthy because it also runs on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, why GrandPerspective? Well, as you may have guessed it's a fun little coding project and I needed to pick something to code on my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>. Having said that, it does have a few things going for it. Firstly, GrandPerspective is developed specifically for Mac OS X, which narrows the immediate competition down to Disk Inventory X, as far as I'm aware. Secondly, GrandPerspective has its own way of visualising directory trees. The layout algorithm that is used is simple and effective, but novel to the best of my knowledge. Also, the file rectangles are drawn to be as clear and unobtrusive as possible. Whether you like it or not is a matter of taste, but you've got a choice. Thirdly, GrandPerspective will intentionally be kept as basic as possible. It should do one thing only, and do it well. That means it is a lean and mean application. GrandPerspective's memory requirements and the size it occupies on disk are pretty minimal. For those concerned about disk space, the latter must count for something, right? Finally, it has a cute logo that will enhance anyone's Dock. ;-) </p>
