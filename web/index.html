<h2>About GrandPerspective</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is a small utility application for Mac OS X that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. It uses a so called tree map for visualisation. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together, but their placement is otherwise arbitrary.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li><p><b>24 Jul Apr 2007</b> GrandPerspective has been downloaded more than 50.000 times. Great! However, I should apologise for the recent lull in activities. I have just been too busy lately. Nevertheless, Version 1.00 is in the making and will appear sometime. Patience, my friends...</p></li>

<li><p><b>18 Apr 2007</b> Thanks to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/disk-space/download-of-the-day-grandperspective-mac-253364.php">lifehacker.com</a> for featuring GrandPerspective as download of the day. It has resulted in another spike in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=148156&ugn=grandperspectiv">download stats</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>28 Mar 2007</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.99 is now available for <a href="#download">download</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>24 Feb 2007</b> GrandPerspective 0.99 has been released. It is the first time the application has been officially released as a Universal Binary (many thanks to <a href="http://www.martinkahr.com">Martin Kahr</a> for providing unofficial Universal Binaries for earlier releases). Furthermore, this latest release offers a choice of file size measures and includes help documentation. It also includes a few minor improvements and bug fixes. Don't linger, just <a href="#download">download</a>.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>3 Feb 2007</b> The GrandPerspective project has received its first donation! Many thanks to the anonymous donor. While on the subject, feel free to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=148156">make a donation</a> yourself to show your appreciation and encourage further development of GrandPerspective.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 Jan 2007</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.98 is now available. You can <a href="#download">download</a> it from the official release area. By the way, <a href="#localization">localizations</a> in additional languages are still greatfully accepted.</p></li>

<li><p><b>15 Dec 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.98 has been released. The main new feature is that user created masking and filtering rules are now automatically stored when the application terminates, so that they are also available the next time. Quite a few other improvements as well, so worth a <a href="#download">download</a> I'd say. But then again, I would say that, wouldn't I?</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Dec 2006</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.97 is now available. It is the first localized GrandPerspective release and includes translations into Japanese, German, and Dutch. <a href="#download">Download</a> it from the official release area if you are interested. Is your favourite language still missing? Maybe you can <a href="#localization">provide it yourself</a>.</p></li>

<h2>Download it</h2></a>

<p>GrandPerspective has been released as <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GNU General Public License</a>. The official release files are available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148156">GrandPerspective download area</a>.
The latest release (Version 0.99) consists of three files:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/grandperspectiv/GrandPerspective-0_99.dmg?download">GrandPerspective-0_99.dmg</a></b> (English)
 
<p>This is the main release file. It contains all you need to run
the application. To install the application, open the disk 
image and drag the application icon onto your Applications
folder, or wher'ever you want to put it onto your file system.
Next, run the application by clicking on the icon.</p></li>

<li><b><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/grandperspectiv/GrandPerspective-0_99-local.dmg?download">GrandPerspective-0_99-local.dmg</a></b> (English, Japanese, German, Dutch)
 
<p>This is the localized version of GrandPerspective. It includes
support for languages other than English.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/grandperspectiv/GrandPerspective-0_99-src.tgz?download">GrandPerspective-0_99-src.tgz</a>

<p>This contains the source code of the application. It consists of
the Objective C source code, as well as various auxiliary files,
such as the nib files that are used to construct the GUI. You need this file if you want to <a href="#localization">create a localization</a> in a language that is not yet supported.</p></li>

<a name="localization">
<h2>Localization</h2></a>

<p>From Version 0.97 onwards GrandPerspective is fully internationalized. This means that it can be localized to support languages other than English. I can manage the translation into Dutch, but for any other language, I will need your help. So, hereby a call for volunteers. If you want to help out with making GrandPerspective available in your mother tongue, or any other language you speak fluently, here is how to go about it:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Go to the GrandPerspective <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=634668">Localization forum</a> to check if somebody is already working on the specific localization you have in mind. If so, see if you can somehow help out. Otherwise, you can announce your plans to work on a new localization on the forum.</p></li>

<li><p>Localize the English resources in the <code>English.lproj</code> folder. You should take the resources from the source code distribution, as this includes the <code>classes.nib</code> and <code>info.nib</code> files that InterfaceBuilder needs. Localize all nib files and all strings files one by one. This requires the use of XCode and InterfaceBuilder. See Apple's developer documentation for details.</p></li>

<li><p>When you think you're done, test your work. Run GrandPerspective using your locaized resources. First check that there is nothing you have forgotten to translate. Secondly, check that everything still works.</p></li>

<li><p>All okay? Then upload your localized resources to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=901452">Localizations Tracker</a>. You could also add a message to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=634668">Localization forum</a>. This way, other users can already use them if they want, and report any problems there may be.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I intend to release a localized version of GrandPerspective, which includes all localizations that have been provided. The aim is to do this <em>four weeks after the release of the English version</em>. This should give enough time for localization to take place, yet means that users won't have to wait too long for this localized release.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>After you have downloaded and run GrandPerspective, feel free to provide feedback:

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770694">browse and submit bug reports</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148156&atid=770697">browse and submit feature requests</a>.</li>
<li>You can also show support by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=148156">making a donation</a> :-).</li>
<li>For other feedback, you can use one of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=148156">forums for GrandPerspective.</a>

<h2>Related software</h2>

<p>GrandPerspective is certainly not the first of its kind. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml">Tree maps have been around for a while</a>, and their application to file systems is not novel either. A few other disk usage visualisation tools that employ tree maps are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/">Sequoiaview</a>, which is the one I bumped into first, because as it happens it was developed in Eindhoven, which is where I currently live.</li>

<li><a href="http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/">KDirStat</a> and <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a> I need to mention, if only because they are also hosted on <a href="sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. I haven't tried them though.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.derlien.com/index.html">Disk Inventory X</a> is noteworthy because it also runs on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, why GrandPerspective? Well, as you may have guessed it's a fun little coding project and I needed to pick something to code on my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>. Having said that, it does have a few things going for it. Firstly, GrandPerspective is developed specifically for Mac OS X, which narrows the immediate competition down to Disk Inventory X, as far as I'm aware. Secondly, GrandPerspective has its own way of visualising directory trees. The layout algorithm that is used is simple and effective, but novel to the best of my knowledge. Also, the file rectangles are drawn to be as clear and unobtrusive as possible. Whether you like it or not is a matter of taste, but you've got a choice. Thirdly, GrandPerspective will intentionally be kept as basic as possible. It should do one thing only, and do it well. That means it is a lean and mean application. GrandPerspective's memory requirements and the size it occupies on disk are pretty minimal. For those concerned about disk space, the latter must count for something, right? Finally, it has a cute logo that will enhance anyone's Dock. ;-) </p>
