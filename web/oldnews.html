<h1>Old news</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><b>18 Apr 2007</b> Thanks to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/disk-space/download-of-the-day-grandperspective-mac-253364.php">lifehacker.com</a> for featuring GrandPerspective as download of the day. It has resulted in another spike in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=148156&ugn=grandperspectiv">download stats</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>28 Mar 2007</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.99 is now available for <a href="#download">download</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>24 Feb 2007</b> GrandPerspective 0.99 has been released. It is the first time the application has been officially released as a Universal Binary (many thanks to <a href="http://www.martinkahr.com">Martin Kahr</a> for providing unofficial Universal Binaries for earlier releases). Furthermore, this latest release offers a choice of file size measures and includes help documentation. It also includes a few minor improvements and bug fixes. Don't linger, just <a href="#download">download</a>.</p></li> 

<li><p><b>3 Feb 2007</b> The GrandPerspective project has received its first donation! Many thanks to the anonymous donor. While on the subject, feel free to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=148156">make a donation</a> yourself to show your appreciation and encourage further development of GrandPerspective.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 Jan 2007</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.98 is now available. You can <a href="#download">download</a> it from the official release area. By the way, <a href="#localization">localizations</a> in additional languages are still greatfully accepted.</p></li>

<li><p><b>15 Dec 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.98 has been released. The main new feature is that user created masking and filtering rules are now automatically stored when the application terminates, so that they are also available the next time. Quite a few other improvements as well, so worth a <a href="#download">download</a> I'd say. But then again, I would say that, wouldn't I?</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Dec 2006</b> A localized version of GrandPerspective 0.97 is now available. It is the first localized GrandPerspective release and includes translations into Japanese, German, and Dutch. <a href="#download">Download</a> it from the official release area if you are interested. Is your favourite language still missing? Maybe you can <a href="#localization">provide it yourself</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>14 Nov 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.97 has been released. It offers a choice of palettes now, all of which more aesthetically pleasing than the original one. You can now also set a few preferences. Go ahead, <a href="#download">download it</a>, and feast your eyes. This version is also fully internationalized. So please help out with <a href="#localization">localization</a> if you can.</p></li>

<li><p><b>12 Aug 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.96 has been released. It supports "filtered" views, and the GUI has been streamlined as well. Don't be shy, <a href="#download">download it</a> and give filtering a try.</p></li>

<li><p><b>5 Jun 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.95 has been released. It includes the ability to "mask" files in the view. This is handy for quickly spotting certain types of files. <a href="#download">Download</a> the latest release and give masking a go.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 May 2006</b> There is now an unofficial Universal Binary for GrandPerspective available, thanks to Martin Kahr. See the <a href="#download">Download section</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 May 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.94 has been released. It includes the new "re-scan" command, which can generate up-to-date views after you have cleaned up your file system a bit. Furthermore, more minor changes to the GUI, as well as to the source code. <a href="#download">Download</a> and enjoy.</p></li>

<li><p><b>14 Apr 2006</b> After noticing a surge in downloads of GrandPerspective I found out that it had been featured as <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/04/download_of_the_day_grandpersp.html">download of the day</a> on O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter.com</a>. Great! By the way, I can generally recommend <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly books</a>, two of which I actually used to develop GrandPerspective.</p></li>

<p>My apologies for the recent lull in GrandPerspective's further development. I have been busy with other things lately, but expect another release soon, hopefully as a Universal Binary.</p></li>

<li><p><b>22 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.93 has been released. It features the most requested feature enhancement so far, the ability to open files in Finder. On top of that, you can now save an image of the directory tree to file. Why are you still reading this? Just <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>10 Jan 2006</b> GrandPerspective 0.92 has been released. I finally had some time to code again, and this new release is the result. It features the new Twin Window command, an improved Duplicate Window command and includes two bug fixes. So go ahead and <a href="#download">download</a> it.</p></li>

<li><p><b>9 Oct 2005</b> Sorry, don't expect any new release of GrandPerspective for the next two months or so. Although I am keen to extend it further, I'm in the process of moving house, which will suck up most of my spare time in the forseeable future. Just so you know...</p></li>
