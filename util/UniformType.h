/* Dynamically constructs the set of types that the receiving type conforms to (directly or

 * Conformance of a given type, typeA, to another type, typeB can be tested as follows:
 *
 *   (typeA == typeB) || ([[typeA ancestorTypes] containsObject: typeB])
 *
 * The reason that there is no method implementing this test directly is that for multiple
 * subsequent conformance tests for the same type, which is typical usage, you should construct the
 * ancestor set only once. This could easily be forgotten if there would be a -conformsTo:
 * convenience method. Furthermore, such a method would also hide the execution overhead associated
 * with conformance tests.
