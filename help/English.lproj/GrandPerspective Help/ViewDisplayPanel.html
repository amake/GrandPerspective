<h1>The view drawer</h1>

<p>
At the bottom right of the <a href="Views.html">view window</a> there is a <b>More...</b> button.
Click on it, and a drawer will appear (click once more, and it disappears again).
The drawer contains three panels.
</p>

<h3>The Info panel</h3>

<p>
The <b>Info</b> panel gives information about the folder that has been scanned.
It shows the name of the folder, and also the time when it was scanned.
When a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been applied, it will also show details of this.
It also shows which <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> has been used, and the total size of the folder is scanned.
</p>

<h3>The Display panel</h3>

<p>
The <b>Display</b> panel enables you to change how the view is drawn.
You can choose from various file coloring options:

<ul>

<li>
<b>Depth</b>: 
The number of sub-folders in the path of each file, relative to the folder that is currently shown in the view, determines the color. 
All files at the same "depth" have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Extension</b>: 
All files with the same extension have the same color.
</li> 

<li>
<b>Folder</b>: 
All files in the same folder have the same color.
</li> 

<li>
<b>Name</b>: 
Files with the same name will have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Nothing</b>:
All files will have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Top Folder</b>:
The first sub-folder in the path of each file, relative to the folder that is currently shown in the view, determines the color.
All files that appear in the same "top folder" have the same color.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Next to that, you can also select on of the various color palette that is provided with the application. 
Just pick one that you suits your taste.
</p>

<p>
You can also configure a mask. 
When you use a mask, only certain files are shown. 
Files that are masked, on the other hand, still take up space but are not drawn. 
Masking can be useful for quickly identifying certain (types of) files, and can also be useful step before applying a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a>. 
Press the <b>Edit</b> button to start editing the <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">mask</a>.
</p> 

<h3>The Focus panel</h3>

<p>
The <b>Focus</b> panel shows the name and size of the folder that is currently shown in the view. 
This is not necessarily the folder that was scanned, because you can navigate down into subfolders.
</p>

<p>
The path of the file that is currently selected is also shown, together with its size. 
Even though this is information is also displayed at the bottom of the view, it is repeated here as long paths may not entirely fit under the view. Furthermore, here you can find the exact size.
