<h1>The view's Focus panel</h1>

<p>
The Focus panel in the <a href="ViewDrawer.html">view's drawer</a> shows the name and size of the folder that is currently shown in the view. 
This is not necessarily the folder that was scanned, because you can <a href="NavigatingViews.html">navigate</a> down into subfolders.
</p>

<p>
The path of the file that is currently selected is also shown, together with its size. 
Even though this is information is also displayed at the bottom of the view, it is repeated here as long paths may not entirely fit under the view. Furthermore, here you can find the exact size.
