<h1>The view drawer</h1>

<p>
At the bottom right of the <a href="Views.html">view window</a> there is a <b>More...</b> button.
Click on it, and a drawer will appear (click once more, and it disappears again).
The drawer contains three panels:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="ViewInfoPanel.html">Info panel</a> gives information about the folder that has been scanned.</li>
<li>The <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display panel</a> enables you to configure how the view is displayed.</li>
<li>The <a href="ViewFocusPanel.html">Focus panel</a> gives information about the folder in the view and the file in focus.</li>
</ul>
