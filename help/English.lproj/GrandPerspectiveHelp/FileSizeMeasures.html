<h1>File size measures</h1>
</div>

<p>
The size of each rectangle in a <a href="Views.html">view window</a> is proportional to the size of the file it represents.
There is, however, more than one way to measure a file's size.
GrandPerspective therefore supports two different file size measures:

<ul>
<li><b>Logical size</b>,
which corresponds to the size of the information in the file. 
For example, the logical size of a simple ASCII text file is the number of characters (including spaces and linebreaks) it contains.</li>

<li><b>Physical size</b>, 
which represents the space that a file actually takes up on disk. 
A file's physical size can be the same as its logical size, but is typically slightly larger due to the way files are stored.
For example, a file with a logical size of ten bytes may, depending on the file system, have a physical size of 1024 bytes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By default, GrandPerspective reports logical file sizes.
You can change the file size measure that is used by changing the application's <b>Preferences</b>.
The changes comes into effect when new folders are scanned.
It does not affect existing views, or views that are <a href="CreatingViews.html">created</a> after re-scanning (as the latter take their settings from their original view).
