<h1>Editing mask and filter rules</h1>
</div>

<p>
When you <a href="EditingMasksAndFilters.html">edit a mask or filter</a>, you can create new rules or modify existing ones.
You can do so from the "Edit filter rule window".
For rules you create from scratch, you can specify a name to help you easily distinguish the various rules.
</p>

<p>
You can choose if the rule should apply to files, to folders, or both.
When a rule is applied to folders, you will not be able to add the tests to the rule that can only be applied to files.
</p>

<p>
A rule should consist of one or more tests, which you enable by the checkboxes at the left and can then subsequently configure.
When a rule consists of multiple tests, all should hold for a file or folder to match the rule.
You can choose from the following tests:

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b>: 
Tests if the name of a file or folder matches any of the targets. 
I.e. the name only needs to match one target for the test to succeed.
</li>

<li><b>Path</b>: 
Tests if the path of a file or folder matches any of the targets. 
The paths are absolute. 
It starts at the root of the file system and includes the item's name.
This is for example also how paths are shown in the view's <a href="ViewFocusPanel.html">Focus panel</a>.
</li>

<li><b>Type</b>: 
Tests if the type of a file equals or conforms to any of the targets.
</li>

<li><b>Hard-linked</b>:
Tests if the file or folder is stored as a <a href="HardLinks.html">hard link</a> on the file system.
</li>

<li><b>Package</b>:
Tests if the file or folder is a package.
(Depending on whether or not package contents are shown, a package is treated as a file or a folder.)
</li>

<li><b>Size</b>:
Tests if the size of a file is above or below a given limit.
</li>

</ul>
