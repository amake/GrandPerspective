<p>
The application can be configured using the Preferences, accessible from the GrandPerspective menu.
Changes to the settings are stored when the application terminates, so that the settings are also used the next time you run the application.
The Preferences panel consists of three parts. 
</p>

<p>
In the <b>View</b> section you can configure whether file deletion is supported in the <a href="Views.html">view window</a>.
You can disable deletion, enable deletion of single files, or enable deletion of entire folders. 
Furthermore, you can specify whether confirmation is required.
<!-- Note: warning repeated in NavigatingViews.html -->
<em>Beware: Deleting folders will move the <em>entire</em> folder to the Trash, including any files in the folder that are not shown in the view.
Files that are not shown can include <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">masked or filtered</a> files, files that could not be scanned because of insufficent permissions, and files that have appeared in the folder after the scan was made.
In short, you should be very careful when deleting folders.
</em>
</p>

<p>
In the <b>Info</b> section you can configure the <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> that is used to report file sizes.
A change to this setting comes into effect when new folders are scanned.
It does not affect existing views, or views that are <a href="CreatingViews.html">created</a> after re-scanning (as the latter take their settings from their original view).
The file size measure that is used by a specific view window can be found in its <a href="ViewInfoPanel.html">Info panel</a>. 
</p>

<p>
From the <b>Display</b> section you can control how a view is shown.
Here you can specify the default color mapping and default color palette.
These settings are used when new views are created. 
You can subsequently still change the color mapping and color palette from the view's <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display panel</a>.
By <a href="EditingFileTypeColorMapping.html">editing the file type color mapping</a> you can control how file types are mapped to different colors.
Changes to this setting affect all views that use coloring by file type.
