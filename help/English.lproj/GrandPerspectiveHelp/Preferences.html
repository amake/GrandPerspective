<p>
The application can be customized using the Preferences, accessible from the GrandPerspective menu.
The Preferences panel consists of three parts: Actions, Info, and Display.
</p>

<p>
In the <b>Actions</b> section you can configure whether file deletion is supported in the <a href="Views.html">view window</a>.
You can disable deletion, enable deletion of single files, or enable deletion of entire folders. 
Furthermore, you can specify whether confirmation is required.
</p>

<!-- Note: warning repeated in NavigatingViews.html -->
<p>
<em>Beware: Deleting folders will move the entire folder to the Trash, including any files in the folder that are not shown in the view.
A file may not be shown because it was <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">masked or filtered</a>, it could not be scanned because of insufficent permissions, or it appeared in the folder after the scan was made.
In short, you should be very careful when deleting folders.
</em>
</p>

<p>
In the <b>Info</b> section you can configure the <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> that is used to report file sizes.
A change to this setting comes into effect when new folders are scanned.
It does not affect existing views, or views that are <a href="CreatingViews.html">created</a> after re-scanning (as the latter take their settings from their original view).
The file size measure that is used by a specific view window can be found in its <a href="ViewInfoPanel.html">Info panel</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The <b>Display</b> section contains settings that affect the appearance of views.
Here you can specify the color mapping and color palette that are used for newly created views. 
You can subsequently still change the color mapping and color palette from the view's <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display panel</a>.
By <a href="EditingFileTypeColorMapping.html">editing the "File type" color mapping</a> you can control how file types are mapped to different colors.
Changes to this setting affect all views that use coloring by file type.
