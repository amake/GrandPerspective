<h1>Saving scan results</h1>
</div>

<p>
There are two ways in which you can save the contents of <a href="Views.html">views</a>, both accessible from the "File" menu:

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <b>Save Scan Data</b> command lets you save all data in the view.
Data is saved to an XML file.
It does not matter which folder is currently displayed in the view, all files &#151;also those not currently shown in the view&#151; are stored.
However, if a <a href="MaskAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been used to create the view then files that have been excluded by the filter will not be stored.
</p>
<p>
The saved data can be loaded into <a href="CreatingViews.html">a new view</a> at a later moment using the <b>Load Scan Data</b> command.
Saving and loading data be useful for the following reasons:
  <ul>
  <li>
  You can <a href="NavigatingViews.html">view and navigate</a> old contents of folders, even when these contents have now changed.
  You can even compare the old contents with the current contents to see where all your disk space has gone.
  Note: If you have Time Machine, you can also view the old contents of folders by <a href="HowToAnalyseTimeMachineBackups.html">scanning folders containing old Time Machine back-ups</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
  You can view and navigate scanned folder contents at another machine.
  </li>
  <li>
  Loading saved scan data is quicker than obtaining the same data by scanning the folder again.
  </li>
  <li>
  Experienced users may process, analyse, and manipulate the saved data using shell scripts or other tools.
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<em>Beware: When viewing loaded scan data, you have to be extra careful using the <b>Delete</b> command.
Files or folders that you select for deletion may have different contents than the view suggests;
folders may contain more files and files may have changed (in size) as well. 
</em>
</p>
</li>

<li>
The <b>Save Image of View</b> command can be used to save a PNG image of the view.
The image will be exactly the same as the image that is shown in the view.
The size, colors and displayed files will all match the current view settings.
You can use these images in many ways: frame them and hang them on your wall, upload them to your blog, email them to friends, etc.
</li>

</ul>
