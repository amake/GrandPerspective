<h1>Saving scan results</h1>
</div>

<p>
There are two ways in which you can save the contents of <a href="Views.html">views</a>, both accessible from the "File" menu:

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <b>Save Scan Data</b> command lets you save all data in the view.
Data is saved to an XML file.
It does not matter which folder is currently displayed in the view. 
All files &#151;also those not currently shown in the view&#151; are stored.
However, if a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been used to create the view then files that have been excluded by the filter will not be stored.
Comments that you enter in the text view in the <a href="ViewInfoPanel.html">Info panel</a> are stored as well.
You can use this to associate useful information with the scan. 
</p>
<p>
The saved data can be loaded into <a href="CreatingViews.html">a new view</a> at a later moment using the <b>Load Scan Data</b> command.
Saving and loading data be useful for various reasons, amongst which the following:
  <ul>
  <li>
  You can <a href="NavigatingViews.html">view and navigate</a> old contents of folders, even when these contents have now changed.
  Comparing the old contents of a folder with the current contents can be useful to determine why your disk space has suddenly all disappeared.
  Note: If you are using Time Machine, you can also view the old contents of folders by <a href="HowToAnalyseTimeMachineBackups.html">scanning old Time Machine back-ups</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
  You can visualise your hard drive using GrandPerspective at another machine.
  </li>
  <li>
  Loading saved scan data is quicker than obtaining the same data by scanning the folder again.
  </li>
  <li>
  Experienced users may process, analyse, and manipulate the saved data using shell scripts or other tools.
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<em>Beware: When viewing loaded scan data, you have to be extra careful using the <b>Delete</b> command.
Files or folders that you select for deletion may have different contents than the view suggests;
folders may contain more files and files may have changed (in size) as well. 
</em>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The <b>Save Image of View</b> command can be used to save a PNG image of the view.
The image will be drawn using the <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display</a> settings of the view and will show the same folder.
The image is a static representation of the data in the view; 
it cannot be loaded into GrandPerspective again for further exploration.
You can, however, upload the image to your blog, email it to friends, or frame it and hang it on your wall :-).

</ul>
