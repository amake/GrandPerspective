<h1>Editing masks and filters</h1>
</div>

<p>
An "Edit Mask" or "Edit Filter" window appears when you respectively need to specify a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">mask or filter</a>.
The window contains two lists.
The list at the left shows the rules that are to be used in the mask or filter.
The list at the right shows all rules that are still available. 
You can select rules that should be used by moving them from the right to the left, using the <b>&lt;</b> button.
</p>

<p>
When there is more than one rule in the mask (or filter), a file or folder only needs to match one for the mask (or filter) to apply.
In other words, the rules are combined using "OR" as opposed to "AND".
</p>

<p>
Most rules only apply to files, but some (also) apply to folders.
When a folder should not be shown, none of its contents will be shown.
When using one or more rules that (also) apply to folders, it therefore rarely make sense to "only show" items matching the rules.
The reason is that a file will then only be shown when <em>all folders in its path</em> (starting from the folder that was scanned) match one of the rules.
</p>

<p>
GrandPerspective comes with a few default rules for masks and filters.
You can create your own rules using the <b>New</b> button, or modify existing rules using the <b>Edit</b> button.
In both cases, a new "Edit filter rule" window will appear where you can <a href="EditingMaskAndFilterRules.html">edit the rule</a>.
Rules that you create or modify are maintained in the rule repository, which is automatically stored in your preferences.
That way they are available next time you run GrandPerspective.
</p>

<p>
You can remove rules that you created, using the <b>Remove</b> button.
You can also use this button to undo changes you have made to the default application-provided rules. 
The rule will then be replaced by the original rule with this name.
