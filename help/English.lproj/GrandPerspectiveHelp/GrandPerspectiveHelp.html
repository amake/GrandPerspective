<h1>GrandPerspective Help</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
GrandPerspective is a utility application that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. 
It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. 
It uses a so called tree map for visualisation.
