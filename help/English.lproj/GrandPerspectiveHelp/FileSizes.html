<p>
The area of each rectangle in a <a href="Views.html">view window</a> is proportional to the size of the file it represents.
You can change both the file size measure and the file size unit system that is used from the application's <a href="Preferences.html">Preferences</a>.
</p>

<h2>File size measures</h2>

<p>
GrandPerspective supports two different file size measures:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Logical size</b>,
which corresponds to the size of the information in the file. 
For example, the logical size of a simple ASCII text file is the number of characters (including spaces and linebreaks) it contains.</li>

<li><b>Physical size</b>, 
which represents the space that a file actually takes up on disk. 
A file's physical size can be the same as its logical size, but is typically slightly larger due to the way files are stored.
For example, a file with a logical size of ten bytes may, depending on the file system, have a physical size of 1024 bytes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>File size unit systems</h2>

<p>
When reporting file sizes, GrandPerspective uses one of the following unit systems:

<ul>
<li><b>Binary</b>,
in this case one kilobyte contains 2<sup>10</sup>=1024 bytes.
Simlarly, a megabyte contains 2<sup>20</sup> bytes, and so on.</li>

<li><b>Decimal</b>,
in this case one kilobyte contains 10<sup>3</sup>=1000 bytes.
Similarly, a megabyte contains a million bytes, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</p>
