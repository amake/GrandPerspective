<p>
When the application starts it prompts you to select a folder. 
After you have selected a folder, the folder is scanned to determine the size of all files in it (including the files in sub-folders). 
Once the scanning is finished a tree map of the scanned folder is shown in a new <a href="Views.html">view window</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are various other ways in which you can create a view:

<ul>

<li>
The <b>Scan Folder</b> command from the "File" menu lets you scan another folder.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Filtered Scan</b> command from the "File" menu lets you scan a folder while immediately applying a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a>.
This way you can for example exclude sub-folders that you are not interested in, which may significantly speed up the time it takes to perform the scan.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Re-scan</b> command from the "File" menu lets you generate an up-to-date version of the current view. 
This is useful when the folder contents have changed, for example because you deleted one or more files. 
The new view will use the same settings as the current view.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Load Scan Data</b> command from the "File" menu lets you create a view with <a href="SavingViewContents.html">scan data that has been saved</a> at an earlier moment.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Duplicate</b> command from the "Window" menu lets you duplicate the current view. 
A new view is created similar to the current one. 
You can subsequently change its display settings to see the tree map in different ways at the same time.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Twin</b> command from the "Window" menu lets you twin the current view.
Twinning a view is very similar to duplicating it, except that navigation is synchronized as well.
</li>

<li>
The <b>Filter</b> command from the "Window" menu lets you apply a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> to the current view.
</li>

</ul>
