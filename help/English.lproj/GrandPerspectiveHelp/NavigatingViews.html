<p>
You can focus on files in a <a href="Views.html">view window</a> by hovering over it with your mouse.
Clicking on a file locks the focus so that it does not change when you move the mouse. 
Click once more, anywhere in the view, to unlock the focus.
When the focus is locked, you can change the folder that is shown in the view. 
By clicking the <b>Down</b> button, you descend into the first subfolder on the path to the selected file. 
You can keep going down, until you've reached the file itself. 
Clicking <b>Up</b> will take you back up, one level at the time.
</p>

<p> 
When the focus is locked, you can show the selected file in Finder using the <b>Reveal</b> button. 
There you can examine the file, rename it, delete it, etc.
