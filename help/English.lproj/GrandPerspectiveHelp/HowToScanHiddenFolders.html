<h1>How to scan hidden folders</h1>

<p>
When GrandPerspective scans a folder, it will include all files and folders that the user is allowed to access.
This includes hidden files and folders (e.g. files whose name start with a dot such as <tt>.DS_Store</tt> files).
However, if you only want to scan in the contents of a single hidden folder, e.g. the <tt>.Trash</tt> folder in your home directory, this is a bit more complicated, as by default hidden files are not shown in the Scan folder dialog.
You can do one of the following to scan a hidden folder:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The first option is to use the
<img src="images/ks_command.gif" hspace=1/><img src="images/ks_shift.gif" hspace=1/><b>G</b>
keyboard shortcut in the Scan folder dialog.
This will let you enter the name of the folder to go to, even if it is hidden.
For example, when you are in your home folder, you can enter <tt>.Trash</tt> to scan the contents of your Trash.
</li>

<li>
Alternatively, you can change the preferences so that hidden files and folders are shown in the Scan folder dialog.
To do so, you have to set <tt>AppleShowAllFiles</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in the GrandPerspective user defaults.
This can be done in the Terminal by entering the following:
<tt>defaults write net.sourceforge.grandperspectiv AppleShowAllFiles -bool yes</tt>.
Please make sure that GrandPerspective is not running when you do this, otherwise there is a chance that the change will be undone by the application.
</li>
