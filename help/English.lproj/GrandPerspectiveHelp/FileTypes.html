<p>
GrandPerspective uses the Uniform Type Identifier system that is part of Mac OS X for classifying files into file types.
A file is mapped to a file type by way of its extension.
For example, files with an <tt>.jpg</tt> or <tt>.jpeg</tt> extension map to the <tt>public.jpeg</tt> type, which represents JPEG images.
A file type can conform to other (more general) file types.
For example, files of type <tt>public.jpeg</tt> conform to the more general <tt>public.image</tt> type.
</p>

<p>
You can color files according to their file type by selecting the "File type" color mapping from the view's <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display panel</a>.
You can change the way the file types are mapped to different colors by <a href="EditingFileTypeColorMapping.html">editing the "File type" color mapping</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: Uniform types were introduced in Mac OS X 10.3, but are only seriously supported from Mac OS X 10.4 onwards.
In Mac OS X 10.3 there is only a very limited number of registered file types; many files will therefore be classified as "unknown file type".
