<p>
For classifying file types, GrandPerspective uses the Uniform Type Identifiers that are part of Mac OS X.
A file is mapped to a file type by way of its extension.
Multiple extensions may correspond to the same file type. 
For example, <tt>.jpg</tt> and <tt>.jpeg</tt> both map to the "public.jpeg" type that represents JPEG images.
File types can conform to other (more general) file types.
For example, files of type "public.jpeg" conform to the more general "public.image" type.
</p>

<p>
You can color files according to their file type by selecting the "File type" color mapping from the view's <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display panel</a>.
You can change the way the file types are mapped to different colors by <a href="EditingFileTypeColorMapping.html">editing the "File type" color mapping</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: Uniform types were introduced in Mac OS X 10.3, but are only seriously supported from Mac OS X 10.4 onwards.
In Mac OS X 10.3 there is only a very limited number of registered file types; many files will therefore be classified as "unknown".
