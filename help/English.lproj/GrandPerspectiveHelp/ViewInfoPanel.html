<h1>The view's Info panel</h1>
</div>

<p>
The Info panel in the <a href="ViewDrawer.html">view's drawer</a> gives information about the folder that has been scanned.
It shows the volume on which the folder resides, the name of the folder, and the time when it was scanned.
The <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> that has been used is shown as well.
When a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been applied, it will also show details of this.
You can edit the text in this text view, which will be stored when you <a href="SavingViewContents.html">save the scan data</a>.
You can use this to associate useful information with the scan.
</p>

<p>
The panel also shows the following five sizes:

<ul>
<li><b>Volume size</b>: The total size of the volume.
</li>
<li><b>Size of scanned files</b>: The total size of the scanned files, using the specified file size measure and after having applied the filter (if any).
</li>
<li><b>Initial free space</b>: The available space on the volume, as reported by the Operating System at the time of the scan.
</li>
<li><b>Miscellaneous used space</b>: All used space that is not accounted for by the size of the scanned files. This includes the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Files that were not scanned, either because the scanned folder was not at the root of the volume, or the user did not have permissions to access all subfolders.
  </li>
  <li>Files that are excluded by the filter (if any).
  </li>
  <li>Disk space that is not accounted for because the Logical <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> is used, which underestimates the space that files actually take up.
  </li>
  <li>Low-level file system data, needed to store amongst others the folder hierarchy.
  </li>
  </ul>  
</li>
<li><b>Freed space</b>: The total size of files that have been deleted from the scanned folder since the scan was made. 
It includes only files that have been deleted using the view's <b>Delete</b> button (or the Delete button of a <a href="CreatingViews.html">twinned or duplicated</a> view).
</li>
</ul>
