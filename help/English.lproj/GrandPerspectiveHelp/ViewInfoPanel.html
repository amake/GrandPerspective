<p>
The Info panel in the <a href="ViewDrawer.html">view's drawer</a> gives information about the folder that has been scanned.
It shows the name of the folder, and also the time when it was scanned.
When a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been applied, it will also show details of this.
It also shows which <a href="FileSizeMeasures.html">file size measure</a> has been used, and the total size of the folder is scanned.
