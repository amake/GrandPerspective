<h1>The view's Focus panel</h1>

<p>
The Focus panel in the <a href="ViewDrawer.html">view's drawer</a> shows the name and size of the folder that is currently shown in the view. 
This is not necessarily the folder that was scanned, because you can <a href="NavigatingViews.html">navigate</a> down into subfolders.
</p>

<p>
The path of the file (or folder) that is currently selected is also shown, together with its size.
The exact size is shown, together with an approximation that is easier to interpret.
When the selected item is a <a href="HardLinks.html">hard link</a>, the size is shown in dark-gray as opposed to black to indicate this. 
When the selected item is a file, its <a href="FileTypes.html">file type</a> is shown, together with a short description.
