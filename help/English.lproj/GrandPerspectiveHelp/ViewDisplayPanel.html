<p>
The Display panel in the <a href="ViewDrawer.html">view's drawer</a> enables you to change how the view is drawn.
You can choose from various file coloring options:

<ul>

<li>
<b>Depth</b>: 
The number of sub-folders in the path of each file, relative to the folder that is currently shown in the view, determines the color. 
All files at the same "depth" have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Extension</b>: 
All files with the same extension have the same color.
</li> 

<li>
<b>Folder</b>: 
All files in the same folder have the same color.
</li> 

<li>
<b>Name</b>: 
Files with the same name will have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Nothing</b>:
All files will have the same color.
</li>

<li>
<b>Top Folder</b>:
The first sub-folder in the path of each file, relative to the folder that is currently shown in the view, determines the color.
All files that appear in the same "top folder" have the same color.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Next to that, you can also select on of the various color palette that is provided with the application. 
Just pick one that you suits your taste.
</p>

<p>
You can also configure a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">mask</a>. 
When you use a mask, only certain files are shown. 
Files that are masked, on the other hand, still take up space but are not drawn. 
Masking can be useful for quickly identifying certain (types of) files, and can also be useful step before applying a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a>. 
Press the <b>Edit</b> button to start <a href="EditingMasksAndFilters.html">editing the mask</a>.
