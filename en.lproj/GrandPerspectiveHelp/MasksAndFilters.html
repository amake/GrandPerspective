<h1>Filters and masks</h1>
</div>

<p>
You can hide files in a view by applying a filter or mask:

<ul>
<li>
A filter omits files from the view entirely.
Files that do not pass a filter are excluded from the view.
A filter always <a href="CreatingViews.html">creates a new view</a>.
</li>

<li>
A mask is a filter that is always applied to an existing view.
A mask hides items that do not pass its filter.
The hidden files are not shown but still take up space in the view.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can apply a mask from the <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display tab</a>.
You can use a mask amongst others to quickly check if a new filter that you are creating behaves as intended.
</p>

<p>
From a view with a mask you can use the "Rescan with mask as filter" option from the  toolbar to create a new window with the mask used as filter.
You can also use the <b>Filter</b> command from the "Window" menu to apply a filter to an existing view.
It is similar except that it does not rescan your disk and lets you select a different filter if you want.
</p>

<p>
Use the <b>Filtered scan</b> command from the "File" menu if you want to apply a filter when scanning new data.
A filter used this way can greatly speed up scans by skipping folders that you are not interested in.
