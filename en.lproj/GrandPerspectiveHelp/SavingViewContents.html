<h1>Saving and exporting scan results</h1>
</div>

<p>
The "File" menu lets you save and export the contents of <a href="Views.html">views</a>.
As a guide, you should save results if you want to load them again in GrandPerspective at a later moment.
You should export scan results if you want to use them elsewhere.
</p>

<h2>Saving scan results</h2>

<p>
The <b>Save Scan Data</b> command lets you save all data in the view.
Data is saved to an XML file.
It does not matter which folder is currently displayed in the view. 
All files &#151;also those not currently shown in the view&#151; are stored.
However, if a <a href="MasksAndFilters.html">filter</a> has been used to create the view then files that have been excluded by the filter will not be stored.
Comments that you enter in the text view in the <a href="ViewInfoPanel.html">Info tab</a> are stored as well.
You can use this to associate useful information with the scan. 
</p>

<p>
The saved data can be loaded into <a href="CreatingViews.html">a new view</a> at a later moment using the <b>Load Scan Data</b> command.
Saving and loading data be useful for various reasons, amongst which the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You can <a href="NavigatingViews.html">view and navigate</a> old contents of folders, even when these contents have now changed.
Comparing the old contents of a folder with the current contents can be useful to determine why your disk space has suddenly all disappeared.
Note: If you are using Time Machine, you can also view the old contents of folders by <a href="HowToAnalyseTimeMachineBackups.html">scanning old Time Machine back-ups</a>,
</li>
<li>
You can visualise your hard drive using GrandPerspective at another machine.
</li>
<li>
Loading saved scan data is quicker than obtaining the same data by scanning the folder again.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Beware: When viewing loaded scan data, you have to be extra careful using the <b>Delete</b> command.
Files or folders that you select for deletion may have different contents than the view suggests;
folders may contain more files and files may have changed (in size) as well. 
</em>
</p>

<h2>Exporting scan results</h2>

<p>
Scan results can be exported in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Export As Image</b> can be used to save a TIFF image of the view.
The image will be drawn using the <a href="ViewDisplayPanel.html">Display</a> settings of the view and will show the same folder.
The image is a static representation of the data in the view; 
it cannot be loaded into GrandPerspective again for further exploration.
You can, however, upload the image to your blog, email it to friends, or frame it and hang it on your wall :-).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Export As Text</b> lets you export the data in a text file.
Each line in the file corresponds to one file.
You can select which properties of the file should be exported.
The properties are separated by tabs in the exported file.
Experienced users can process, analyse, and manipulate the exported data using shell scripts or other tools.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
